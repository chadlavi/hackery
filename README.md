Hackery
=======

One page wonder WordPress theme. Originally built for [SolidarityNYC](http://solidaritynyc.org/) and extended to support the [PRISM Breakup](http://prismbreakup.org/) event.

1. Install Advanced Custom Fields plugin
2. Go to Tools > Import > WordPress (install Plugin, activate, got to WordPress importer)
3. Import included advanced-custom-field-export.xml
4. Go to Settings > Media and set Medium image size to 505 x 9999 and Large image size to 730 x 9999
5. Go to Settings > Permalinks and choose the Post Name setting

Use Pages and child Pages to build your site structure. There are some custom post types and Advanced Custom Fields settings specific to [PRISM Breakup](http://prismbreakup.org/), which I may remove at some point in the future. But maybe you can rework them for your own purposes.
